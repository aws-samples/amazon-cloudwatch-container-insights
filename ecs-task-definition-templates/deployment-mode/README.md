## Example Amazon ECS task definitions based on deployment modes

You can deploy CloudWatch Agent into Amazon ECS clusters to enable various functionality: StatsD, AWS SDK Metrics, Prometheus Monitoring, etc.

For each of these features, you can deploy the CloudWatch Agent in one or more of the following deployment modes:
* Sidecar - CloudWatch Agent works at the Task level. Reasons for choosing this mode include but are not restricted to:
  * You expect a dedicated CloudWatch Agent for your Task.
* Service - CloudWatch Agent works at the Cluster level. Reasons for choosing this mode include but are not restricted to:
  * You expect CloudWatch Agent to serve for all Tasks within a Cluster.
  * You expect an centralized endpoint within a cluster for your application to access.
  * You expect an application outside the cluster to be able to access to CloudWatch Agent.
* DaemonService - CloudWatch Agent works at the Container Instance level (for Amazon ECS clusters with an EC2 launch type). Reasons for choosing this mode include but are not restricted to:
  * You expect CloudWatch Agent to serve for all Tasks within a Container Instance.
  * You expect CloudWatch Agent to collect metrics for each Container Instance.
  * You expect CloudWatch Agent to be scaled according to the number of Container Instance automatically.

You can choose the mode that is most suitable for you.
